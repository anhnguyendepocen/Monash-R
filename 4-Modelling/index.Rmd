## Your turn

- What is a model?



##Outline

- Linear Regression

##Real estate prices

```{r}
library(readr)
realestate <- read_csv("http://dicook.github.io/Monash-R/4-Modelling/data/realestate.csv")
str(realestate)
```

##Real estate prices

\verb=realestate= is a data set consisting of observations on the sales price of 522 homes along with numerous characteristics of the home and property

We might be interested in how the price is affected by these characteristics

##Fitting a regression

Fitting a regression model in \R is accomplished through the ```lm``` command

```
lm(formula, data, weight, na.action)
```

A formula has the form 

```y ~ x1 + x2 + x3```

where ```y``` is the dependent (price) and ```x1, x2, x3``` are the covariates


##A first model

```{r}
lm(price ~ sqft, data=realestate)
```
Estimate for Intercept is the average price of a 0 sqft home ... doesn't make much sense :)

... but, with an increase of the square footage the price increases ... that DOES make sense

(1 sq ft = 0.093 sq m or 1 sq m = 10.8 sq ft)

***
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(sqft, price, data=realestate) + geom_smooth(method="lm") + theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

Problem: the variance of the prices increases with the size of the homes.

Solution: use a transformation (square root or log) for the price

***

Using a log transformation, variability stabilizes (not perfect, but better)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(sqft, log(price), data=realestate) + geom_smooth(method="lm") + theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```


***
First model then becomes

```{r}
lm(log(price)~sqft, data=realestate)
```

***
Models are objects, too (so save model into a named object)

```summary``` provides a nicer overview of the model output

```{r}
m1 <- lm(log(price)~sqft, data=realestate)
summary(m1)
```

##Adding effects

```update``` uses an existing model object and allows for changes of the effects

```.~.+ac``` keeps left hand side (. on the left of the ~) the same and adds ```ac``` to the existing right hand side 

```{r}
m2 <- update(m1, .~.+ac)
```

***

```{r}
summary(m2)
```

***

R can deal with categorical and quantitative variables in ```lm```

only value for houses with ac (```acyes```) is shown - ```acno``` is used as baseline, and by default set to 0

```{r}
options()$contrasts
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?contr.treatment
```

##Interpreting Coefficients

!!!Beware transformations!!! they make interpretations tricky sometimes

log of price is expected to be higher by 1.589e-01 for houses with an AC ... same as ...

price of the house is on average ```exp(1.589e-01) = 1.172221``` fold higher with AC than the same house without an AC (i.e. AC leads on average to a 17% increase in price)



##Model comparisons

Is model ```m2``` actually an improvement over ```m1``` ?

Statistical answer: 

```{r}
anova(m1, m2)
```
Yes, duh.

##Visually:

```{r}
qplot(sqft, log(price), colour=ac, data=realestate) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

Yes, but there are not that many houses without AC, so ```ac``` might not matter terribly much. Visualization gives us a more nuanced answer than the test.

##More effects

Trying to capture the curvature in ```log(price)```:

```{r}
m3 <- lm(log(price) ~ poly(sqft, 2) + ac, data=realestate)
anova(m2, m3)
```

##Visualizing models

```{r}
realestate$fitted.m3 <- fitted(m3)
ggplot(data=realestate, aes(y=log(price), x=sqft, colour=ac)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y=fitted.m3))
```

## Your turn

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

- Extend model ```m3``` of the ```realestate``` data some more and try to find at least two effects that significantly affect prices.

- Visualize the impact those additional effects have on the model

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide'}
m4 <- update(m3, .~.+quality+log(lot))
anova(m3, m4)
realestate$fitted.m4 <- fitted(m4)

ggplot(data=realestate, aes(y=log(price), x=sqft, colour=ac)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y=fitted.m4)) + 
  facet_wrap(~quality)

# pretty hard to visualize the second continuous variable ... idea, make it discrete
# 
realestate$lot.discrete <- cut(realestate$lot, breaks=c(0,35000, 100000), labels=c("large", "huge"))
ggplot(data=realestate, aes(y=log(price), x=lot, colour=ac)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y=fitted.m4)) + 
  facet_wrap(lot.discrete~quality)


qplot(bed, log(price), data=realestate, geom="boxplot", group=bed)
qplot(bed, log(price), data=realestate, geom="boxplot", group=bed) + facet_wrap(~quality)

m4b <- update(m4, .~.+bed+I(bed==0) + built)
```

##Specifying Interaction terms

```x:y``` specifies the interaction between variables ```x``` and ```y```

```x*y``` specifies the main effects ```x```, ```y``` and the interaction

```(a + b + c)^2``` specifies all main effects and pairwise interactions

```(a + b + c)^2 - b:c``` specifies all main effects and pairwise interactions, but not the b-c interaction

```-1``` removes the term for the intercept


##Making Predictions

Suppose we have model

```{r}
m5 <- lm(log(price) ~ sqft + bath + built + log(lot), data = realestate)
```

> Suppose a new house is going on the market and the seller wants to use this model to get an idea of a reasonable listing price. This house is 2123 sq. ft. with 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a 20590 sq. ft. lot, and was built in 1963.

```{r}
new_house <- data.frame(sqft = 2123, bath = 2, built = 1963, lot = 20590)

predict(m5, newdata = new_house, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95) # log(price)!
exp(predict(m5, newdata = new_house, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95))/1000
```


#Model Diagnostics

##Assumptions of a (normal) linear model 

Using linear regression models we inherently make the following assumptions:

- Normally distributed errors
- Constant error variance
- Linearity in the parameters
- Independent (uncorrelated) errors

Also generally want to check for collinearity and influential points

##Assessing normality of residuals


We can assess the assumption of normality using a normal probability plot of residuals (sometimes called a normal ```qq``` plot)

Idea of normal qq plot:

- Plot the empirical cdf of the errors against the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution
- If errors are normal empirical and theoretical quantiles will be proportional
- Look for a straight line relationship in the plot


```{r}
m5 <- lm(log(price) ~ sqft + bath + built + log(lot), data = realestate)
```

***
```{r}
realestate$resid.m5 <- residuals(m5)
realestate$fitted.m5 <- fitted(m5)
ggplot(aes(sample = resid.m5), data=realestate) + geom_qq() + theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

The wavy pattern indicates a slightly heavy tail in the residuals. 

##Unlogged price is worse deviation from normality

```{r}
m5b <- lm(price ~ sqft + bath + built + log(lot), data = realestate)

realestate$resid.m5b <- residuals(m5b)
ggplot(aes(sample = resid.m5b), data=realestate) + geom_qq() + theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

##Equal variance and linearity

We can assess the assumptions of equal error variance and linearity using residual plots

Idea of checking residual plots:

  -  plot model residuals against predicted values in scatterplot
  -  (linearity) points should show no distinct shape or clustering
  -  (equal variance) scatter of points should not widen or constrict over range of predicted values

##Residual plots

```{r}
qplot(data=realestate, x=fitted.m5, y=resid.m5) + xlab("Fitted Values") + ylab("Residuals") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) + geom_smooth()
```
Linearity and equal variance look pretty good



## Your turn

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

- Use unlogged price in a linear model and draw the residual plot. What do you find?


##Test for Equal Error variance

Many R packages available to do specific statistical diagnostics tests
```lmtest``` package contains many of these tests, such as a Breusch-Pagan test for equal variances

```{r}
library(lmtest)
bptest(m5)
```

... so there's still heteroskedasticity in those errors ... darn!

##Box-Cox transformations

Box Cox method for transformations selects a data transform based on the relationship between the observed mean and variance

$$
y_i^{(\lambda)} =
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{y_i^\lambda - 1}{\lambda} & \text{if } \lambda \neq 0, \\[8pt]
\ln{(y_i)} & \text{if } \lambda = 0,
\end{cases}
$$

Use ```boxcox()``` function from the ```MASS``` package to ballpark a $\lambda$

*** 

```{r}
library(MASS)
bc <- boxcox(m5b)
```

***
```{r}
str(bc)
lambda <- bc$x[which.max(bc$y)]
```

Now re-fit model with transformed price ...

```{r}
m5c <- lm(price^lambda ~ sqft + bath + built + log(lot), data=realestate)
bptest(m5c) # better but still not non-significant
```

***
```{r}
qplot(fitted(m5c), residuals(m5c)) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) + geom_smooth()
```

Interpretation of model coefficients has become even more tricky ...

##Other model diagnostics

- on the model level: AIC, BIC, $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$, ...

- on the coefficient level: VIF (Variance Inflation Factors), ...

- on the point level:

    - High leverage (more potential to be influential)
    - DFFITS (too much influence on its own fitted value)
    - Cookâ€™s D (too much influence on all fitted values)
    - DFBETAS (too much influence on estimated parameters)
    
R can calculate every single one of them ... and more ...
    
#Working with lots of models

## Why would we even do that???

- Hans Rosling can explain that really well in his [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en)

- gapminder software 

- gapminder also makes data available (in R through the package ```gapminder```)


##First Look

```{r}
library(gapminder)
qplot(data=gapminder, year, lifeExp, geom="line", group=country)

```

How would you describe this plot?

##Using models as exploratory tools

- Idea: fit a line to each one of the countries' life expectancies
- then use e.g. intercept and slope to characterise groups of countries

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)

gapminder2 <- gapminder %>% mutate(year = year-1950)
by_country <- gapminder2 %>% 
  group_by(continent, country) %>% 
  nest()

by_country <- by_country %>% mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, ~ lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = .))
)

by_country <- by_country %>% unnest(model %>% purrr::map(broom::tidy))
country_coefs <- by_country %>% select(continent, country, term, estimate) %>% spread(term, estimate)

qplot(`(Intercept)`, year, data=country_coefs, colour=continent) + scale_colour_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
  xlab("Average Life Expectancy in 1950") +
  ylab("Average Gain in Life Expectancy per Year")
```

##Prepping

- This is hot off the press (presented by Hadley Wickham last week at WOMBAT)
- you might have to re-install the packages ```tidyr``` and ```purrr```, i.e. run the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("purrr")

library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
```

##Australian Life Expectancy

```{r}
oz <- subset(gapminder, country=="Australia")
head(oz)
```

##Life Expectancy in Australia since 1950

```{r}
qplot(data=oz, year, lifeExp) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

##Life Expectancy in Australia since 1950

```{r}
oz.lm <- lm(lifeExp~year, data=oz)
oz.lm
```

Intercept is estimated life expectancy at 0 BC - let's use 1950 for the first value:

```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>% mutate(year = year-1950)
```

##Nesting data

We don't want to subset the data for every country ... 

```nest()``` makes a data frame part of another data frame:

```{r}
by_country <- gapminder %>% group_by(continent, country) %>% nest()
head(by_country)
```

***

Each element of the ```data``` variable in ```by_country``` is a dataset:

```{r}
head(by_country$data[[1]])
lm(lifeExp~year, data=by_country$data[[1]])
```

##Fitting multiple models

Now we are using the ```map``` function in the package ```purrr```.

```map``` allows us to apply a function to each element of a list.

```{r}
by_country$model <- by_country$data %>% purrr::map(~lm(lifeExp~year, data=.))
head(by_country)
```

##On to the ```broom``` package

```broom``` allows to extract values from models on three levels:

- for each model: ```broom::glance```
- for each coefficient in the model: ```broom::tidy```
- for each value in the dataset: ```broom::augment```

```{r}
library(broom)
broom::glance(by_country$model[[1]])
broom::tidy(by_country$model[[1]])
```

***
```{r}
broom::augment(by_country$model[[1]])
```

##Extract values for each coefficient

Extract all countries automatically (hello ```map``` again!)

```{r}
by_country_coefs <- by_country %>% unnest(model %>% purrr::map(broom::tidy))
coefs <- by_country_coefs %>% select(country, continent, term, estimate) %>% spread(term, estimate)
```

and finally, a visualization:

```{r}
qplot(`(Intercept)`, year, colour=continent, data=coefs)
```

##Extract other model diagnostics

```{r}
by_country <- by_country %>% unnest(model %>% purrr::map(broom::glance))
by_country$country <- reorder(by_country$country, by_country$r.squared)
qplot(country, r.squared, colour=continent, data=by_country) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-90, hjust=0)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

## Compare groups of countries

```{r}
country_all <- by_country %>% unnest(data)
qplot(year+1950, lifeExp,  data=subset(country_all, r.squared <= 0.45), geom="line") +
  facet_wrap(~country)
```
What do the patterns mean?

***

```{r}
qplot(year+1950, lifeExp,  data=subset(country_all, between(r.squared, 0.45, 0.75)), geom="line") +
  facet_wrap(~country)
```

## Your turn

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

- extract residuals for each of the models and store it in a dataset together with country and continent information

- plot residuals across the years and fit a smooth. What does the pattern mean?
