## Warmups

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.height = 4,
  fig.width = 8,
  fig.align = "center",
  cache = FALSE
)
```


## Using the packages tidyr, dplyr

```{r, results='hide'}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data(french_fries, package = "reshape2")
knitr::kable(head(french_fries), format = "markdown", row.names = FALSE)
```

## French fries - hot chips

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. First few rows:


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(french_fries), format = "markdown", row.names = FALSE)
```

## What are the questions that we would want to answer?

- Is the design complete?
- Are replicates like each other?
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ?
- Are raters giving different scores on average?
- Do ratings change over the weeks?

## Completeness

If the data is complete it should be 12 x 10 x 3 x 2, that is, 6 records for each person. (Assuming that each person rated on all scales.)

## Check completeness

```{r}
french_fries %>% 
  select(subject, time, treatment) %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  count(subject, time) %>%
  spread(time, n)
```

## Side-by-side boxplots

How would we go about creating this plot?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10, ]

library(ggplot2)
qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, fill = I("red"), geom = "boxplot") +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), fill = I("orange")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), fill = I("yellow")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), fill = I("green")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10, ]

library(ggplot2)
qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, fill = I("red"), geom = "boxplot") +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), fill = I("orange")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), fill = I("yellow")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), fill = I("green")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

* We can do better!

## What we have and what we want

<div align="center">
  <img src="reshape.png" width="900" height="550"/>
</div>

## Gathering

- When gathering, you need to specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures).

Keys/Identifiers:
- Identify a record (must be unique)
- Example: Indices on an random variable
- Fixed by design of experiment (known in advance)
- May be single or composite (may have one or more variables)

Values/Measures:
- Collected during the experiment (not known in advance)
- Usually numeric quantities

## Gathering the French Fry Data

```{r}
library(tidyr)
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty)

head(ff_long)
```

## Much better

```{r}
ff_long_sub <- ff_long[ff_long$time == 10, ]

qplot(variable, rating, data = ff_long_sub, fill = variable, geom = "boxplot")
```

## Long to Wide

In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (Perhaps displaying in a table).

```{r}
head(ff_long)
```

## Spread

We use the **spread** function from tidyr to do this:

```{r}
french_fries_wide <- spread(ff_long, key = variable, value = rating)

head(french_fries_wide)
```

## YOUR TURN

1. Read in the billboard top 100 music data, which contains N'Sync and Backstreet Boys songs that entered the billboard charts in the year 2000

```{r}
billboard <- read.csv("http://dicook.github.io/Monash-R/data/billboard.csv")
```

2. Use `tidyr` to convert this data into a long format appropriate for plotting a time series (date on the x axis, chart position on the y axis)
3. Use `ggplot2` to create this time series plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
long_billboard <- gather(billboard, key = week, value = rank, X1:X76)
long_billboard$week <- as.numeric(gsub("X", "", long_billboard$week))

qplot(week, rank, data = long_billboard, geom = "line", colour = artist, group = track)
```

## The Split-Apply-Combine Approach

<div align="center">
  <img src="splitapply.png" width="900" height="550"/>
</div>

## Split-Apply-Combine in dplyr

```{r}
library(dplyr)
french_fries_split <- group_by(ff_long, variable) # SPLIT
french_fries_apply <- summarise(french_fries_split, rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE)) # APPLY + COMBINE
french_fries_apply
```

## The pipe operator

- dplyr allows us to chain together these data analysis tasks using the `%>%` (pipe) operator
- `x %>% f(y)` is shorthand for `f(x, y)`
- Example:

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    gather(key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty) %>%
    group_by(variable) %>%
    summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## dplyr verbs
 
There are five primary dplyr **verbs**, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- Filter: Remove the rows of a data frame, producing subsets
- Arrange: Reorder the rows of a data frame
- Select: Select particular columns of a data frame
- Mutate: Add new columns that are functions of existing columns
- Summarise: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame
    
## Filter

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
```

## Arrange

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
```

## Select

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

## Summarise

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

## YOUR TURN

Read in the flights data:
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```
This dataset contains information on over 300,000 flights that departed from New York City in the year 2013.

1. Using dplyr and the pipe operator, create a data frame consisting of the average arrival delay (``arr_delay``) based on the destination airport (``dest``). Sort this data frame in descending order, so the destination airport with the largest delay is first.
2. Find out the most used airports for each airline carrier.

## Dates and Times

Dates are deceptively hard to work with in R.

**Example**: 02/05/2012. Is it February 5th, or May 2nd?

Other things are difficult too:

- Time zones
- POSIXct format in base R is challenging

The **lubridate** package helps tackle some of these issues.

## Basic Lubridate Use

```{r, results='hold'}
library(lubridate)

now()
today()
now() + hours(4)
today() - days(2)
```

## Parsing Dates

```{r, results='hold'}
ymd("2013-05-14")
mdy("05/14/2013")
dmy("14052013")
ymd_hms("2013:05:14 14:50:30", tz = "America/Chicago")
```

## YOUR TURN

1. Using the `flights` data, create a new column Date using lubridate. You will need to paste together the columns year, month, and day in order to do this. See the `paste` function.
2. Use dplyr to calculate the average departure delay for each date.
3. Plot a time series of the date versus the average departure delay

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3}
flights$date <- ymd(paste(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day, sep = "-"))
delay.dat <- flights %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

qplot(date, dep_delay, geom = "line", data = delay.dat)
```

## CO2 data

For time series handling

## Bioinformatics data - Michelle's example

String manipulation

## Paintings data

## TODO

* SQL/JOINS with dplyr and flight data? (Carson)
* dplyr do() + tidyr::unnest() (Carson)
* more with tidyr
* reading different data formats: image, json, audio, xml/html, ncdf, excel/sas/stata, GIS files, (Di)
