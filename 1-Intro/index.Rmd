# With your neighbor, list some things R _is_ and _does_

### R is ...
### R does ...

## R is ...

* __Free__ to use
* __Extensible__
    * Over 7300 user contributed add-on packages currently on CRAN!
* __Powerful__
    * With the right tools, get more work done, faster.
* __Flexible__
    * Not a question of _can_, but _how_.
* __Frustrating__
    * Flexibility comes at a cost (easy to shoot yourself in the foot!).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("metacran/crandb")
# pkgs <- crandb::list_packages(limit = 999999)
# length(pkgs)
# [1] 7330
```

## R does ...

* __Graphics, statistics, machine learning, etc.__
* __Data acquisition, munging, management__
* __Literate programming (dynamic reports)__
* __Web applications__

(This roughly serves as our outline. Slides and material can be found at [http://dicook.github.io/Monash-R/](http://dicook.github.io/Monash-R/).)

## RStudio is ...

[From Julie Lowndes](http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/):  

<blockquote>
<b>If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport</b>, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer.

## Hello R Markdown!

- [Download](index.Rmd), save, and open the document which generates these slides in RStudio (you can do that with this R code):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
curl::curl_download(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dicook/Monash-R/gh-pages/1-Intro/index.Rmd",
  "index.Rmd"
)
file.edit("index.Rmd")
```

- [Download](index.R), save, and open the corresponding R script.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
curl::curl_download(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dicook/Monash-R/gh-pages/1-Intro/index.R",
  "index.R"
)
file.edit("index.R")
```

## What is R Markdown?

- From the [R Markdown home page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/):

<blockquote>
R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of __markdown__ (an easy-to-write plain text format) __with embedded R code chunks__ that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible (they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).
</blockquote>

- RStudio's [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) gives a nice, concise overview of its capabilities.

- RStudio's [reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) lists its options.

## Some Basics

* Combine values into a vector with `c()`

```{r}
c(0, 1)
```

* Assign values to a name with `<-`

```{r}
x <- c(0, 1)
```

* Avoid `for` loops and use built-in _vectorized_ functions

```{r}
sum(x + 10)
```

* Although arcane at times, `R` has rich support for documentation, see `?sum`

---

* Use `[` to extract elements of a vector.

```{r}
c("a", "b")[1]
c("a", "b")[c(T, F)]
```

* Extract _named_ elements with `$`, `[[`, and/or `[`

```{r}
x <- list(
  a = 10,
  b = c(1, "2")
)
x$a
x[["a"]]
x["a"]
```

## Examining 'structure'

* `str()` is probably my favorite `R` function. It shows you the "structure" of _any_ R object (and _everything_ in R is an object!!!)

```{r}
str(x)
```

* Lists are heterogenous (elements can have different types)
* Vectors are homogenous (elements have the same type)
    * That's why `c(1, "2")` ends up being a character string.

* If you'd like to know more, see Hadley Wickham's online chapters on [data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) and [subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)

## Getting Help

* Reading documentation only gets you so far. What about _finding_ function(s) and/or package(s) to help solve a problem???

* Google! (I usually prefix "CRAN" to my search; others might suggest <http://www.rseek.org/>)

* Ask your question on a relevant StackExchange outlet such as  <http://stackoverflow.com/> or <http://stats.stackexchange.com/>

* It's becoming more and more popular to bundle "vignettes" with a package (__dplyr__ has _awesome_ vignettes)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("dplyr")
```

## Some Oddities

* Yes, `+` is a function (which calls compiled C code)

```{r}
`+`
```

* What's that? You don't like addition? Me neither!

```{r}
"+" <- function(x, y) "I forgot how to add"
1 + 2
```

* But seriously, don't "overload operators" unless you know what you're doing

```{r}
rm("+")
```

## Trust me

## Obligatory economics example

```{r}
data(economics, package = "ggplot2")
# data frames are essentially a list of vectors
str(economics)
```

## Your turn

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

Read the documentation for `economics`. Can you think of a interesting/informative function of these variable(s)?

## Hello ggplot2

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy / pop)) + 
  geom_line()
p
```

## Hello Linear/Additive Models!

```{r, fig.show = 'hold'}
p
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
p + geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F)
p + geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cr"), se = F)
```

## How does `geom_smooth()` work?

```{r}
m <- lm((unemploy / pop) ~ date, data = economics)
str(m)
```

---

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10}
economics$yhat <- m$fitted.values
ggplot(economics) + 
  geom_line(aes(date, unemploy / pop)) +
  geom_line(aes(date, yhat), color = "blue")
```

## Your turn

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

Make the loess smoother plot without `geom_smooth()` (hint: convert `date` to a numeric vector with `as.numeric()` and use `loess()`). For a solution, see [here](https://github.com/cpsievert/slides/blob/gh-pages/intro/yourTurn1.R)

## Time Series Analysis

* `R` has a ton of support for time series analysis (see the [Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html)). 

* To create a time series (aka `"ts"`) object, use the `ts()` function

```{r}
r <- ts(economics$unemploy / economics$pop)
str(r)
class(r)
ar1 <- arima(r, order = c(1, 0, 0))
class(ar1)
```

---

```{r}
str(predict(ar1))
```

* From `?predict`:
    * `predict()` is a _generic function_ for predictions from the results of various model fitting functions. The function invokes particular _methods_ which depend on the class of the first argument.

* Since `class(ar1)` is `"Arima"`, `predict(ar1)` calls `predict.Arima()`.

* Base R comes with a bunch of prediction methods, and add-on packages can easily add new prediction methods for new classes.

---

```{r}
methods(predict)
```

---

`summary()` is another useful generic function. Turns out `summary.Arima()` doesn't exist in base `R`, but the __forecast__ package provides one for us %^)

```{r}
library(forecast)
summary(ar1)
```

---

```{r}
methods(summary)
```


## Your turn

- Have a look over `?predict` and `?predict.Arima`. Forecast 10 steps ahead using the `ar1` model. See [here](https://github.com/cpsievert/slides/blob/gh-pages/intro/yourTurn2.R) for a solution.
- Have a look over `?forecast` and `?forecast.Arima`. How is `predict.Arima()` different from `forecast.Arima()`?
- **Warning**: Solution is on the next page, are you sure you want to continue?

## Forecast package

The `forecast()` function in the __forecast__ package makes it easy to construct and plot prediction intervals.

```{r}
forecast(ar1, level = 95)
```

---

```{r, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 10}
plot(forecast(ar1, level = 95))
```

## Your turn 

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

Can you reconstruct `plot(forecast(ar1, level = 95))` using __ggplot2__? Here are some hints:

* `as.data.frame(forecast(ar1, level = 95))` gives you the forecast data. Modify the column names so they don't have spaces (see `?names`).
* You'll need the corresponding forecast dates. See `?seq.Date` for creating a sequence of dates.
* `geom_ribbon()` is helpful for plotting the uncertainty.

See [here](https://gist.github.com/cpsievert/62d6f5ddcdb923324e2a) for a solution

```{r eval=FALSE}
# to run the your turn solution...
devtools::source_gist("62d6f5ddcdb923324e2a")
```

## Interactive and web-based!

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```

## Reshaping data

<div align="center">
  <img src="reshape.png" width="900" height="500">
</div>

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(economics)
```


```{r}
head(economics)
```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
e <- gather(economics, variable, value, -date)
head(e)
```

---

```{r, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 10}
ggplot(e, aes(date, value)) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_y")
```

## Pure functional programming


Pure functions _modify_ a central object-type (e.g., input a data frame and output another data frame)

## Your turn

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

Have we encountered any 'pure' function(s)? Can you think of any other pure functions?

## Pure functions in base R


```{r}
subset(
  transform(
    economics,
    year = format(date, "%Y")
  ),
  year == 2000
)
```

---

<div align = "center">
  <img src="pure.jpeg" width="900" height="300" />
</div>

---

__magrittr's__ `%>%` operator makes it much easier to read a sequence of pure manipulations

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
economics %>%
  transform(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  subset(year == 2000)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# in general, this:
f(g(x), y) 
# equal this
x %>% g() %>% f(y)
```

> - `%>%` allows us to read left -> right (instead of inside -> out)

## dplyr: A consistent grammar of data manipulation

```{r}
library(dplyr)
economics %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  filter(year == 2000)
```

## Split-apply-combine

</div>

## Split-apply-combine in dplyr

```{r}
economics %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mpce = mean(pce))
```

## Your turn

![](rainbow-lorikeet.png)

Find the average annual personal savings rate (`psavert`)

```{r echo=FALSE}
economics %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mpce = mean(psavert))
```


## A new example: babynames

```{r}
library(babynames)
head(babynames)
dim(babynames)
```

## Write/read csv (or other flat files)

```{r, cache = TRUE}
library(readr)
bb_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv", tmpdir = ".")
write_csv(babynames, bb_path)
read_csv(bb_path)
```

## Get other formats into R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl)
read_excel("my-spreadsheet.xls", sheet = "data")
read_excel("my-spreadsheet.xls", sheet = 2)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(haven)
# SAS files
read_sas("path/to/file")
# SPSS files
read_por("path/to/file")
read_sav("path/to/file")
# Stata files
read_dta("path/to/file")
```

## dplyr loves databases

```{r}
db <- src_sqlite("babynames.sqlite3", create = TRUE)
if (!db_has_table(db$con, "babynames")) {
  copy_to(db, babynames)
}
```

```{r}
db
tbl(db, "babynames")
```

## Send computation to the data

```{r}
h <- db %>% 
  tbl("babynames") %>%
  filter(name == "Hilary")
```

```{r}
class(h)
h$query
# execute SQL query and bring into R
hc <- collect(h)
class(hc)
hc
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# unfortunate hack needed for the time being
hc <- as.data.frame(hc)
```

## Interactive graphics

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10, cache = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
plot_ly(hc, x = year, y = prop, color = sex, colors = c("blue", "hotpink"))
```

---

```{r}
popular <- babynames %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(N = sum(n)) %>%
  arrange(desc(N))
popular
```

---

```{r}
top <- top_n(popular, 1000)
topnames <- subset(babynames, name %in% top[["name"]])
topnames
```

---

<iframe src="http://104.131.111.111:3838/topnames/" width="1000" height=800></iframe>

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
ui <- bootstrapPage(
  selectizeInput(
    inputId = 'name', 
    label = 'Enter a name', 
    choices = unique(topnames$name),
    selected = "James",
    multiple = TRUE
  ),
  plotOutput('plot')
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot({ 
    dat <- subset(topnames, name %in% input$name)
    ggplot(dat, aes(year, prop, colour = sex)) + 
      geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ name)
  })
}
runApp(shinyApp(ui, server))
```
